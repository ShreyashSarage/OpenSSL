# OpenSSL

-> can be used for creating key-pairs

-> certificates

-> It can be used for calculating "hash"(encrypted data) or encrypt a confidential file

### Use OpenSSL 
-> It has implementations for almost all type of cryptographic functions.

-> You can use it to encrypt your document or to sign your document.

-> You can also use it set up tls on your webserver.

### Important
    OpenSSL is opensource and it is available for all OS.

#### Two important libraries in OpenSSL

``` LIBSSL ``` -> LIBSSL is used to preform TLS related operations and LIBSSL is dependent on LIBCRYPTO

```LIBCRYPTO``` -> LIBCRYPTO is used by OpenSSL to perform cryptographic operations such as encryption, signing, etc...


### Five Pillars of OpenSSL

### Integrity

-> SHA1 and SHA256 are the normal text files which contains the hash of the software (i.e checksum which checks for error)

## Confidential

### symmetric key(secret key)

#### How to generate symmetric key

    openssl rand -hex 10

    openssl rand -hex -out encryption.key 32 

#### How to generate assymmetric key
    
    openssl genrsa //asymmetric(private key) generate
    openssl genrsa -out  key.pri 2048

-> Private keys are used to sign or decrypt data

-> But to encrypt we need public key

#### Public key

-> how public key is used to encrypt data
    openssl rsa -in key.pri -pubout -out key.pub
    
#### OpenSSL list commands

    openssl list -digest-algorithms

    openssl list -cipher-algorithms

    openssl list -public-key-algorithms

    openssl aes-256-cbc -in hello.txt -out hello.enc -e -kfile encryption.key

    openssl aes-256-cbc -in hello.enc -hell.dec -d -kfile encryption.key 

    openssl des-ede3-cbc -in hello.txt -out hello.enc -e -a
    //-a tells openssl to encrypt in base64 format

    openssl aes-256-cbc -in hello.enc -out hello.dec -d -a -kfile encryption.key -pbkdf2 

### NOTE
    if we do not pass the key then OpenSSL prompts for password and it uses the password to create a key for encrypting the data


-> you can also define the iterations for openssl to create salt from hash of your password by adding a flag -iter  1000 in above command

-> if you try to decrypt with wrong iteration, openssl will throw an error of bad decrypt.

### Task to implement on the above covered topics
    Q. Perform encryption/decryption using "aes-256-cbc" without using key file





-> Authentication 

-> Authorization 

-> Non-Repudiation


-> If we are using here -pubin tp tell openssl that we are suing public key , to encr












->a digital signature generated by a private key owner can be verified by someone who has the associated public key.
->it can also be used as a proof that the signed data  wasn't tempered.
